# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Dynamic Routes and Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when combining dynamic routes and data fetching.  The issue involves inconsistencies in how data is fetched and rendered, leading to unexpected results or errors.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when a dynamic route attempts to fetch data using `async/await` inside the `page` component. Under certain conditions (such as specific navigation patterns or timing), the data fetching might not complete before rendering, leading to an incorrect or incomplete UI.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to different dynamic routes, observing the potential inconsistencies in data display.

## Expected Behavior
Data fetching should always complete before rendering, ensuring consistent and accurate display regardless of navigation patterns.

## Actual Behavior
In certain scenarios, the component may render before the data has fully loaded, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate information. 

## Solution
The provided solution uses various approaches such as loading states and suspense to manage the asynchronous data fetching and provide a better user experience.
